For example: _donfack_branch_. On this branch, you will regularly push your work during the exam session.<br><br>By the end of the exam, you are going to create two additional branches:<br>1. _testing_donfack_branch_: This branch will be used for AI detection tools.<br>2. _dev_branch:_ This branch will be reviewed once the other two branches are successful.<br><br>So, by the end of the exam, your work should be on three different branches:<br>1. _donfack_branch:_ Your development branch.<br>2. _testing_donfack_branch:_ This branch will be used for AI detection tools.<br>3. _dev_branch:_ This branch will be reviewed once the other two branches are successful.<br><br>*Note:* AI detection tools like ZeroGPT and Winston AI will be used, and tools such as SonarLint, SonarQube, and Qodana will be used to analyze and correct your work.<br>2. Take notes of the responsive view. <br>The main aim of the test is to assess the student's ability to create reusable components, structure their work efficiently, and meet the client's demands. You can find all the resources (colors, fonts, images, and logo) in the Figma design.<br><br>Any detection of AI tools in your algorithm will be considered as a zero and as an inability to think independently.<br><br>When using your classes for styling, use the _class="header_donfack"_ annotation as we saw during the course.<br><br>Failure to respect these instructions will result in the tools being unable to analyze your work, and a score of 0/<a href="tel:100">100</a> will be registered.<br><br>Good luck to all!<br>Best regards,<br>*Eng.
